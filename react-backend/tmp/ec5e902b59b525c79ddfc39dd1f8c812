1. what is the world of mobile app needs
In the world of mobile app development, we’re always looking for 
a. shorter development cycles, 
b. quicker time to deployment, 
c. better app performance.

2. what is Hybrid app frameworks
an app built with technology many developers already know (like JavaScript, or HTML5 and CSS) that’s wrapped in a container allowing it to run natively on a device.
Hybrid app frameworks have come a long way to bridge the gap between the performance of a native app and the ease of development of a web app. On the leading edge of this technology is Facebook’s React Native user interface (UI) design framework.

3. why react native
a.  IT’S GOT IOS AND ANDROID COVERED.
b.  REUSABLE COMPONENTS ALLOW HYBRID APPS TO RENDER NATIVELY.
c.  Apply React Native UI components to an existing app’s code—without any rewriting at all.
d.  IT’S ONE OF THE TOP MOBILE JAVASCRIPT FRAMEWORKS AMONG DEVELOPERS—AND GROWING
e.  REACT NATIVE IS ALL ABOUT THE UI.
f.  NATIVE APP DEVELOPMENT IS MUCH MORE EFFICIENT.
g. IT OFFERS THIRD-PARTY PLUGIN COMPATIBILITY, LESS MEMORY USAGE, AND A SMOOTHER EXPERIENCE.
